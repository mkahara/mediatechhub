Hide/show/restrict elements based on user roles like administrator in WPBakery page builder (formerly Visual Composer).

== Description ==

This plugin adds settings to all elements in WPBakery page builder to hide/show the content elements on your website based on user roles. This way you can easily restrict content in WPBakery pages and posts.

For example you can hide a specific column element on your page or post for all users but editors or only show it to logged-out users.

By default (with no checkboxes checked) the content will be visible for all users.

The hidden content will also be removed from the HTML.
